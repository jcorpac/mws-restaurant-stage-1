## Project Attribution

This project is an extension of a [starter project](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) provided by Udacity, as part of their Front End Web Developer NanoDegree program. The starter project provided a working application which presented information on restaurants in New York City. As a student, I was required to update the application to display correctly on mobile web browsers and desktop. I also added a service worker for local data caching, and to make the site compatible with screen readers for accessibility.

Source code for this project is available at `https://github.com/jcorpac/mws-restaurant-stage-1`

## Dependencies

The restaurants applciation is built using HTML and JavaScript, and the files required for displaying the site, and its data are included in the repository. The application makes use of the Google Maps application and a connection to the internet is required to display maps on the screen.
